<p>On October 7, we started our <a href="./2019-fundraiser.es.html">yearly donation
campaign</a>. Today, we summarize what we achieved with
your help in 2019.</p>

<p>If you liked our work in 2019, please take a minute to donate and make Tails
thrive in 2020!</p>

<h1>Easier adoption by new users</h1>

<p>In 2019, we focused on fewer but critical features to make Tails easier to
discover and adopt for first time users.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In January, we completely changed the Tails installation procedure.  Tails
is now downloaded as a <em>USB image</em>: an exact copy of the data as it is
written to the USB stick.</p>

<p>This made the installation experience better for all operating
systems and particularly easier and much faster for less
tech-savvy users of <a href="../install/win/usb.es.html">Windows</a> and
<a href="../install/mac/usb.es.html">macOS</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, we improved our documentation to help first time users with their
Tails installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We explained better how to <a href="../install/win/usb.es.html#wi-fi">troubleshoot failing
Wi-Fi</a>, an issue unfortunately quite common,
especially on Mac, and documented which Wi-Fi USB adapters work well in
Tails.</p></li>
<li><p>We created a <a href="../install/win/usb.es.html#animation">boot menu animation</a> to
visualize how to start Tails on PC and clarified related troubleshooting
instructions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>As a consequence, more people than ever are using Tails:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tails is used nearly 25 000 times every day worldwide. That&#39;s 15% more
than in August 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>The percentage of people using Tails on Mac more than doubled since
January 2019.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To continue making Tails more accessible to users globally, we built a
<a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/">translation platform</a> for our website.
Since then, people started translations in Arabic, Catalan, Traditional and
Simplified Chinese, Polish, Russian, Serbian, and Turkish.</p>

<p>We also improved a lot the usability of the Welcome Screen for non-English
users in <a href="./version_4.0.es.html#greeter">Tails 4.0</a>.</p>

<h1>Maintenance work</h1>

<p>2019 was also a year of heavy maintenance work, as always. Keeping alive a
tool like Tails consists mostly of many tasks that are not very exciting:
publishing new releases every 6 weeks, updating Tails and our infrastructure
to new versions of Debian and other software that we use, fixing small
issues as they are reported to us, and implementing the many small
improvements that make Tails easier to use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In October, we released <a href="./version_4.0.es.html">Tails 4.0</a>, which is the first
version of Tails based on Debian 10 (Buster).</p>

<p>Tails 4.0 was our most important release in years. Tails 4.0 adds
KeePassXC, OnionShare 1.3.2, fixes Electrum, updates to Debian 10 and
GNOME 3.30, starts faster and uses less memory.</p></li>
<li><p>We released 13 new versions of Tails to deliver improvements and security
fixes as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>We published more emergency releases than ever before: 5 emergency
releases to fix 5 critical security vulnerabilities in Firefox and Tor
Browser and always keep Tails as secure as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>We removed less popular software and localization packages, which you can
now install yourself using the <a href="../doc/first_steps/additional_software.es.html">Additional
Software</a> feature. Optimizations like
these made the USB image of Tails 4.0 47 MB smaller than Tails 3.6, which
was the bigger release ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Tails depends on a wider ecosystem of Free Software and privacy tools. We
continuously contribute improvements to other projects which are either
included in Tails or used on our infrastructure. Some of these projects,
that we call &quot;upstream&quot;, are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=971347">Thunderbird</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/merge_requests/263">GNOME</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1062740/accepted-apparmor-2133-5-source-into-unstable/">Debian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1036041/accepted-onionshare-20-1-source-all-into-unstable/">OnionShare</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/2593">KeePassXC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1037418/accepted-torsocks-230-2-source-amd64-into-unstable/">torsocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=911356">ikiwiki</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We had to temper several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial%2Dof%2Dservice%5Fattack">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks targeting our
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>For 9 years, we have been relying on the hosting services provided by the
fine people of boum.org. Thank you! As they were reducing their
activities, we had to migrate our services. Our website is now self-hosted
and our mailing-lists are taken care of by 2 experienced and trusted
autonomous server projects: <a href="https://autistici.org">autistici.org</a> and
<a href="https://puscii.nl">puscii.nl</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Community</h1>

<p>Over the years, Tails has been able to gather a lively community which is
growing, evolving, and deserves care.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We published a statement of our <a href="../contribute/mission.html">mission and values</a>
to help us clarify who we are, what we stand for, and what we want to do
for our users.</p></li>
<li><p>We agreed on <a href="../contribute/personas.html">user personas</a>, fictitious but
concrete representations of the people using Tails. We use these personas
to keep in mind who we are working for, what are their needs, and what
Tails should do for them.</p></li>
<li><p>We attended 9 conferences and connected to Free Software and Internet
freedom communities in 9 different countries, including FOSDEM (Belgium),
Internet Freedom Festival (Spain), Tor Meeting (Sweden), OTF Summit
(Taiwan), DebConf (Brazil), and MozFest (UK).</p></li>
<li><p>The wider Tails community organized 10 workshops to present Tails to new
users in North and South America, Europe, and East and South-East Asia.</p></li>
<li><p>We answered 883 bug reports through our help desk and helped all these
people to be safer online.</p></li>
<li><p>2 new workers joined our help desk and sysadmin teams.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All of this is made possible by donations from people like you. And because
these help us to plan our work, we particularly appreciate monthly and
yearly donations, even the smallest ones.</p>

<p>If you liked our work in 2019, please take a minute to donate and make us
thrive in 2020!</p>
