<h1>Releases</h1>

<p>Tails 1.0 was released on April 29.</p>

<h1>Metrics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Tails has been started more than 292&nbsp;595 times in April.
This make 9&nbsp;753 boots a day in average.</li>
<li>35&nbsp;029 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO.</li>
<li>105 reports were received through WhisperBack.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Code</h1>

<ul>
<li>Quite some work was put into adapting Tails to Debian 7 (Wheezy).
The result will be released on June 10, as Tails 1.1.

<ul>
<li>Thanks to the amazing work done in Debian by Ulrike, we are
almost there when it comes to adding back support for
OpenPGP signature verification in Nautilus (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6608">#6608</a>).</li>
<li>The Vagrant setup was
fixed to allow
building Tails/Wheezy images in RAM (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7132">#7132</a>).</li>
<li>Synaptic was made to
start again on
Wheezy (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7055">#7055</a>).</li>
<li>The Debian Mozilla team&#39;s repository used on the devel branch
was updated for Wheezy (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7063">#7063</a>).</li>
<li>The latest version of the MAT
is now installed (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5792">#5792</a>).</li>
<li>Initial progress
was made to
update the Windows camouflage.
<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6342">#6342</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The APT suite being used when building from the stable branch
was corrected (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7022">#7022</a>).</li>
<li>The new logo
was
integrated in the <em>About Tails</em> dialog (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7096">#7096</a>).</li>
<li>Some Vagrant compatibility issues
were fixed
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7134">#7134</a>).</li>
<li>The blacklisting of directory authority keys that have been used
with versions of OpenSSL affected by Heartbleed
was backported into our Tor packages.</li>
<li>Our modified Tor Launcher
was updated to avoid
<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6934">pretending that we ship a default set of bridges</a>.</li>
<li>I2P was explicitly
told that it cannot receive inbound connections (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7070">#7070</a>).</li>
<li>An attempt at migrating our source tree to live-build 3.x
was made
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5691">#5691</a>). It is still entirely unclear whether the
cost/benefit ratio is worth it, especially because live-build 4.x
has already gone quite further in terms of incompatibilities, and is
far from being ready for prime-time yet.</li>
<li>A patch to make the Greeter&#39;s help window resolution-aware was
<a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005451.html">proposed</a>
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7009">#7009</a>).</li>
<li>Another proposed patch aims at fixing the Tails Installer fonts size
on Wheezy (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5673">#5673</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Documentation and website</h1>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../support/faq.en.html">FAQ</a> was published.</li>
<li>The logo that <a href="./and_the_winner_is.en.html">won</a> the
contest was integrated
in the website, and on the boot loader&#39;s splash screen
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7090">#7090</a>).</li>
<li>Some initial steps <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/451f/tails/log/?h=websitemodernization">were
walked</a>
to modernize our website&#39;s markup and CSS, including moving to HTML5
and better responsiveness (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7021">#7021</a>).
Compatibility with older browsers is left to be tested before we can
apply these changes to the live website.</li>
<li>Many documentation pages were deeply reworked as part of <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5977">#5977</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../index.html">homepage</a> now
makes it clear that
Tails is based on Debian, Tor, and is Free software.</li>
<li>The MAC spoofing documentation
now explains
why we do not randomize the OUI part of MAC addresses.</li>
<li>The way to update our Tor Launcher is
now documented.</li>
<li>The I2P documentation
was slightly improved.</li>
<li>The CSS of the boxed titles was improved (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6323">#6323</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Translation</h1>

<ul>
<li>The German translation team has been making great progress, and we
are not considering dropping this language from our website anymore.</li>
<li>The French translation team got a new member.</li>
<li>The Italian translation team has been reviewing strings in
Transifex, and working on their internal workflow and processes.
There is hope that they start translating the website soon.</li>
<li>A list of glossaries used by translation teams <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6968">is being compiled</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<ul>
<li>Quite a lot of progress was made to make our automated test suite
support Tails based on Debian Wheezy
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6559">#6559</a>).</li>
<li>An automated test case
was written
to check write access to the boot device via udisks <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6275">#6275</a>.</li>
<li>Our Jenkins master configuration was migrated to
a published module.</li>
<li>We now install debomatic from wheezy-backports, for easier
maintenance and a more stable infrastructure.</li>
<li>Thanks to Alster&#39;s suggestion, the boum.org administrators could
<a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005392.html">add a few security-oriented HTTP
headers</a>
to our website.</li>
<li>Jurre van Bergen has requested an audit by OpenITP&#39;s Peer Review
Board (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6889">#6889</a>).</li>
<li>For ethical reasons, we have renamed our <em>Broken Window</em> Redmine
category to <em>Hole in the Roof</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>On-going discussions</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005476.html">Improving our
website</a>
in various ways.</li>

volume</a>
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5301">#5301</a>).</li>
<li>Jacob Appelbaum expressed interest in <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005413.html">getting a grsec-patched Linux
kernel</a>
into Tails. Of course, this requires doing the same in Debian, which
is not a trivial mission.</li>

the Freedom of the Press Foundation has made great progress. It is
still time to donate.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Outreach</h1>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="./test_UEFI.html">call for testing</a> for the upcoming UEFI support

<li>2014-04-17: Bruce Schneier writes &quot;Nice article on the Tails
stateless operating system. I use it.&quot; <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/tails.html">in a blog
post</a>.</li>
<li>2014-04-14: In the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/4/11/video_glenn_greenwald_laura_poitras_q">press
conference</a>
she held after winning a Polk Award for her reporting on Edward Snowden and
the NSA, Laura Poitras said &quot;We just published a blog about a tool that&#39;s
called Tails, which is a operating system that runs on either USB stick or SD
disc, that is a sort of all-in-one encryption tool that you can use for PGP
and encryption. And it&#39;s just really secure. [...] So, it&#39;s a really important
tool for journalists.&quot;</li>
<li>2014-04-14: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/tails/">Out in the Open: Inside the Operating System Edward
Snowden Used to Evade the NSA</a>
by Klint Finley, in Wired.</li>
<li>2014-04-02: In <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa">Help Support the Little-Known Privacy Tool That Has
Been Critical to Journalists Reporting on the
NSA</a>
by Trevor Timm:

<ul>
<li>Laura Poitras says: &quot;I&#39;ve been reluctant to go into details about
the different steps I took to communicate securely with Snowden to
avoid those methods being targeted. Now that Tails gives a green
light, I can say it has been an essential tool for reporting the
NSA story. It is an all-in-one secure digital communication system
(GPG email, OTR chat, Tor web browser, encrypted storage) that is
small enough to swallow. I&#39;m very thankful to the Tails developers
for building this tool.&quot;</li>
<li>Glenn Greenwald says: &quot;Tails have been vital to my ability to work
securely on the NSA story. The more I&#39;ve come to learn about
communications security, the more central Tails has become to
my approach.&quot;</li>
<li>Barton Gellman says: &quot;Privacy and encryption work, but it&#39;s too
easy to make a mistake that exposes you. Tails puts the essential
tools in one place, with a design that makes it hard to screw them
up. I could not have talked to Edward Snowden without this kind of
protection. I wish I&#39;d had it years ago.&quot;</li>
