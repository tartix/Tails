<h1>Releases</h1>

<p>Tails 0.22 was released on December 11.</p>

<p>Tails 0.22.1 is scheduled for January 21. The schedule for the next
releases is on our <a href="../contribute/calendar.html">calendar</a>.</p>

<h1>Metrics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Tails has been started more than 218&nbsp;512 times in December.
This make 7&nbsp;049 boots a day in average.</li>
<li>17&nbsp;791 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO.</li>
<li>103 reports were received through WhisperBack.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Code</h1>

<p>New features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Huge progress was made on the
MAC spoofing feature, that <a href="./spoof-mac.en.html">can now be
tested</a> (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5421">#5421</a>).</li>
<li>Experimental UEFI support was completed and is been tested. A bit
more work <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5739">is needed</a>, though.</li>
<li>The last mile was basically
completed
regarding incremental upgrades, that will be enabled by default
starting with Tails 0.22.1 (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6014">#6014</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>Work in progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Wolinsky has <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004517.html">started
porting</a>
the WiNoN design to Tails: multiple, independent VMs connected to
independent paths through the Tor network in order to wear multiple
hats. Also, as David put it: &quot;There are other benefits of using VMs
as the Whonix folks have recognized&quot; (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5748">#5748</a>).</li>
<li>We have struggled against a <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6460">memory wipe
regression</a> on some hardware with recent Linux kernels. No success
so far.</li>
<li>Some progress was made towards the
migration to Wheezy (Tails 1.1).</li>
<li>Early support for
<a href="http://web.monkeysphere.info/monkeysign/">Monkeysign</a> was
merged
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6455">#6455</a>), but <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6515">more work
is needed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bug and regression fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable
WebRTC (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6468">#6468</a>).</li>
<li>Fix keyboard shortcuts
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6478">#6478</a>).</li>
<li>Use the
same User-Agent in htpdate as in the Tor Browser (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6477">#6477</a>).</li>
<li>Fix the
Unsafe Browser configuration (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6479">#6479</a>).</li>
<li>Set the browser
icon to IE&#39;s one in Windows camouflage mode.</li>
</ul>


<p>Branches pending review:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install a 64-bit
kernel.</li>
<li>Install
poedit from official backports was proposed (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6456">#6456</a>).</li>
<li>Do not
create auto-login text consoles (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5588">#5588</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>And also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tor 0.2.4 is
now stable!</li>
<li>The Persistent Volume Assistant now <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5311">displays nicer paths</a>. Thanks to Andres Gomez!</li>
<li>Torbutton was
upgraded to 1.6.5.3 (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6566">#6566</a>).</li>
<li>Our Tor Browser build and runtime dependencies
were updated.</li>
<li>We have fixed various NSS security issues in squeeze-backports
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6497">#6497</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h1>Documentation and website</h1>

<ul>
<li>A branch to
clean up our ikiwiki configuration was started.</li>
<li>The Mac installation
instructions were made
a bit safer.</li>
<li>The links to files and branches in cgit were fixed.</li>
<li>The tails-support mailing list is now mentioned on <a href="../contribute/how/help.html">Help other
Tails users</a>.</li>
<li>The documentation for incremental upgrades was written.</li>
<li>The documentation for MAC spoofing was drafted.</li>
<li>The <a href="../support/faq.en.html">draft FAQ</a> has now more content.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<h2>Test suite</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Tails automated test suite
can now be run on pure Debian Wheezy
with backports (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6399">#6399</a>). This allowed us to update
the test suite to match current code, fix many bugs in it, and
improve style a bit. Most of this was merged, but a few more
branches are pending review: <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5959">#5959</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5465">#5465</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6544">#6544</a>.</li>
<li>Our automated test suite was
partially ported to the feature/wheezy branch.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Build system</h2>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to David Wolinsky and others, our Vagrant setup
was
updated to work with newer Vagrant (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6221">#6221</a>), and
the corresponding basebox updated to include up-to-date Debian
archive keys. While we were at it, a few lurking bugs were fixed.</li>
<li>Thanks to WinterFairy, <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/winterfairy/tails/log/?h=feature/import-translations-extern">it is now
easy</a>
to import translations from Transifex into our various
Git repositories.</li>
</ul>


<h1>On-going discussions</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004362.html">Tor Browser branding in Tails?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004520.html">Risks of enabled/disabled TCP
timestamps?</a>
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6579">#6579</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Funding</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Freedom of the Press Foundation launched a <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/">campaign to support
encryption tools for
journalists</a>. Tails is among
the projects this campaign gathers fund for.</li>
<li>The proposal we have sent to sponsor Echo was accepted.</li>
<li>Our grant proposal with sponsor Charlie was rejected.</li>
<li>We are slowly making progress on our grant proposal with
sponsor Golf.</li>
<li>We have almost completed a proposal to be sent to sponsor Lima.</li>
<li>Our contract with sponsor Bravo is now finished.</li>
<li>Tails will soon accept donations in currencies other than Bitcoin.</li>
<li>We are now very likely to create a non-profit organization dedicated
to Tails.</li>
<li>We have almost wrapped-up our bounties program. A report will be
published soonish.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Outreach</h1>

<p>Tails participated in the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page">30th Chaos Communication
Congress</a>. It was
a great opportunity to meet, in person, a few existing and new
contributors, as well as many people we are working with.</p>

<p>A self-organized event called <em>Tails needs your help</em> was organized
(<a href="https://tails.boum.org/promote/slides/2013-12-29_-_Tails_needs_your_help.shtml">slides</a>).
It was a success considering the late notice.</p>

<p>See you next year, probably with more space and events dedicated
to Tails!</p>

<h1>Press and testimonials</h1>

<ul>
<li>2013-12: Bruce Schneier
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8ibh/iama_security_technologist_and_author_bruce/cdknf7a">answered</a>
to someone asking him what Linux distribution is its favorite: &quot;I don&#39;t
use Linux. (Shhh. Don&#39;t tell anyone.) Although I have started using Tails&quot;.</li>
<li>2013-12-12: In <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html">A conversation with Bruce
Schneier</a>,
as part of the &quot;Snowden, the NSA and free software&quot; cycle at
Columbia Law School NYC, Bruce Schneier says:

<ul>
<li>&quot;I think most of the public domain privacy tools are going to be
safe, yes. I think GPG is going to be safe. I think OTR is going
to be safe. I think that Tails is going to be safe. I do think
that these systems, because they were not -- you know, the NSA has
a big lever when a tool is written closed-source by a for-profit
corporation. There are levers they have that they don&#39;t have in
the open source international, altruistic community. And these are
generally written by crypto-paranoids, they&#39;re pretty well
designed. We make mistakes, but we find them and we correct them,
and we&#39;re getting good at that. I think that if the NSA is going
after these tools, they&#39;re going after implementations.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What do I trust? I trust, I trust Tails, I trust GPG [...]&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We can make it harder, we can make it more expensive, we can make
it more risky. And yes, every time we do something to increase one
of those, we&#39;re making ourselves safer. [...] There are tools we
are deploying in countries all over the world, that are keeping
people alive. Tor is one of them. I mean, Tor saves lives. [...]
And every time you use Tor [...] provides cover for everyone else
who uses Tor [...]&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jacob Appelbaum stated at the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/Fahrplan/events/5713.html">Chaos Communication
Congress</a>:
&quot;if you are a journalist and you are not using Tails, you should
probably be using Tails, unless you <em>really</em> know what
you&#39;re doing&quot;.</li>
