<h1>Releases</h1>

<p>Tails 0.22.1 was released on February 4.</p>

<h1>Metrics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Tails has been started more than 222&nbsp;134 times in February.
This make 7&nbsp;933 boots a day in average.</li>
<li>453&nbsp;082 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO. Weird.</li>
<li>92 reports were received through WhisperBack.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Code</h1>

<p>New features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great progress was made towards better integrated, and more usable,
support for using
Tor bridge (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5479">#5479</a>). This implied working with
the TBB team to improve Tor Launcher, so that we can start it as
a standalone XUL application, instead of as a browser add-on.</li>
<li><a href="../contribute/design/MAC_address.html">MAC spoofing support</a> was
completed and
merged (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5421">#5421</a>).</li>
<li>Phase four of incremental upgrades was completed
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6508">#6508</a>), and given it was enabled by default in
Tails 0.22.1, most users will see it in action when 0.23 is out.</li>
<li>One may now
start IBus manually in locales
environment where it is disabled by default (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6656">#6656</a>).</li>
<li>Ship a 64-bit
kernel in replacement for the 686-pae one (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5456">#5456</a>).</li>
<li>The branch to
stop creating auto-login text consoles was merged
(<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5588">#5588</a>).</li>
<li>Support for persistence of I2P state was
drafted (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5544">#5544</a>).</li>
<li>The website
lock down was merged and deployed.</li>
<li>A branch to
stop installing Cookie
Monster was prepared (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6790">#6790</a>).</li>
<li>Some initial work to improve the Greeter&#39;s administration password
interface was done (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5594">#5594</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>Software updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>I2P has been updated to 0.9.11 (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6696">#6696</a>).</li>
<li>We have uploaded Pidgin 2.10.9 to squeeze-backports, and we now
install it from there (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6661">#6661</a>).</li>
<li>Install
Poedit from squeeze-backports-sloppy, where we have
uploaded it some time ago (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6456">#6456</a>).</li>
<li>The fact that Linux 3.12 is not in Debian unstable anymore
was taken into account.</li>
<li>The branch that
installs Linux 3.13 was updated.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bug and regression fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Intel Management Engine Interface driver
was disabled. This fixes memory wiping
at shutdown (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6460">#6460</a>) on some, if not all, hardware.</li>
<li>The possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser
was added back (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6383">#6383</a>).</li>
<li>An issue that lead to releasing needlessly big ISO images
was
resolved (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6390">#6390</a>).</li>
<li>feature/create-additional-software-config
was merged.</li>
</ul>


<p>Towards Tails based on Debian Wheezy:</p>

<ul>
<li>I2P packages compatible with Debian Wheezy were prepared, and are
now installed in the feature/wheezy branch.</li>
<li>Application launchers were added to the GNOME panel.</li>
<li>A launcher to start the documentation viewer was added to the
applications menu.</li>
<li>A more standard icon is used for the shutdown button.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Documentation, website and localization</h1>

<ul>
<li>Icons for the different roles on the Contribute section were
finalized and <a href="../contribute.en.html">deployed live</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../support/faq.en.html">FAQ</a> was greatly expanded, and is now almost ready
for prime-time.</li>
<li>We have made good progress on specifying how the Tails logo should
look like (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5797">#5797</a>).</li>
<li>It was documented how to <a href="../contribute/how/debian.html">improve Tails by working on
Debian</a>. We have received positive feedback
from Debian contributors about it.</li>
<li>Many small improvements to the documentation and its translations
were done, including:

<ul>
<li>quite a few clarifications in the documentation for new
contributors;</li>
<li>updated system requirements documentation;</li>
<li>documented how to change the passphrase for the
persistent volume (<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5621">#5621</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Links to the I2P website were
updated.</li>
<li>Documentation for the new MAC address spoofing feature was drafted.</li>
<li>Work is in progress on documentation about contributing to Tails in
the infrastructure (systems administration, automation) area.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<ul>
<li>Our Puppet modules were <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/">published</a>.
This was a first blocker before we can welcome contributions to
our infrastructure.</li>
<li>The system that hosts our Redmine
was re-installed from scratch on a new machine, upgraded to Debian
Wheezy and to Redmine 1.4.4.</li>
<li>Some improvements to our automated test suite were merged:
test/fix-persistence-checks,
test/keep-volumes-tag, and
test/5959-antitest-memory-erasure.
Thanks to this and the robustness improvements brought by the move
to RJB, we were finally able to remove two of the most painful sets
of tests from our manual test suite.</li>
<li>A mailing list for early testers was created and is being set up.</li>
</ul>


<h1>On-going discussions</h1>

<li>We were contacted by a few people who want to use Tails as
a flexible framework, and build customized derivatives on top of it.</li>
<li>We are discussing who we will invite to the 2014 Tails contributors
summit, that should be a bit more crowded than usual.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Funding</h1>

<ul>
<li>We have discussed with GNOME how they could use the money they have
raised for privacy and anonymity improvements.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Outreach</h1>

<ul>
<li>We have been working with people who want to build bridges between
the graphics designers and usability experts community on the one
hand, and Free Software developers on the other hand. Thanks to this
collaboration, it is likely that Tails will go through a usability
study in a few months, followed by a hackfest that will put at work
designers and usability experts for finding solutions to (some of)
the identified issues. The Tails sprint in July might host
this hackfest.</li>
<li>One of us attended FOSDEM, and got a chance to talk with many
interesting people in person there.</li>
<li>We got in touch with the people behind
<a href="https://www.freepto.mx/">Freepto</a>, and are looking how our two
projects could collaborate more.</li>
<li>We are participating in two new Debian teams: the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/OTR">Debian OTR
Team</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/Contribute">Debian AppArmor
Profiles Team</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Press and testimonials</h1>

<ul>
<li>2014-02-27: In his article &quot;<a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/02/why-its-vital-public-fund-open-source-encryption-tools">Why It&rsquo;s Vital For Users to Fund Open-Source
Encryption
Tools</a>&quot;
Trevor Timm from Freedom of the Press Foundation explains that Tails &laquo; has
been vital for most, if not all, of the NSA journalists. [...] Its prime use
case is journalists trying to communicate or work in environments in which
they may normally be at risk or compromised. The NSA stories have been the
biggest story in journalism in the past decade, yet the tool the reporters
rely on is incredibly underfunded, is maintained by only a handful of
developers, and operates on a shoestring budget. &raquo;</li>
<li>2014-02-07: In his review of <a href="http://uvirtus.org">uVirtus</a>, Kheops, from
Telecomix concludes that &laquo;&nbsp;Users should prefer Tails and other mature secure
live distributions (such as IprediaOS, Libert&eacute; Linux, Privatix and Whonix)
over uVirtus since they provide a real safety improvement to the user. For any
activity that does not entail transferring large quantities of data (such as
video files), there is no strong reason to prefer uVirtus over any of these. &raquo;</li>
