<div id="content" role="main">
<p>A bunch of people spend a dozen days together in July at the third Tails
developers yearly summit. This was a great opportunity to have crazy hacking
sessions in person, as well as to discuss where we are heading to and how.</p>

<h1>Discussions</h1>

<p>We mainly discussed the <strong>growth of the project</strong>: given the growing number
of users and our super-short release cycle, it is a challenge to keep the
project sustainable and maintainable in the mid/long term.</p>

<p>Our take on this is first reflected by <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/roadmap">our
<strong>updated roadmap</strong></a>: we now have a better vision of what we want to
focus on for the next major releases of Tails: the 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0
milestones are now pretty well defined, and we even were bold enough
to draft goals for 3.0.</p>

<p>Another key aspect on this topic was that we need to <strong>make it easier to
contribute</strong> to Tails. We have listed many enhancements that could be made
in this direction, especially <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=115">on the
website</a>.
We also have identified areas that could benefit most from a few new
dedicated contributors. We will publish targeted calls for help in the next
few months.</p>

<p>We also <strong>redesigned our communication channels</strong> to ease involvement of new
contributors, to make more workload sharing possible, and to be able to
provide better user support. In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our mailing lists see quite a lot of traffic these days.  This might
deter people from reading it. So, we will create two specialized mailing
lists: a private, encrypted one will receive bug reports, while a public
one will be dedicated to user support.</li>
<li>A growing FAQ will be assembled: it will be a tool for self-service
help, and should make support work less repetitive.</li>
<li>In a few months, we will evaluate how all this fares and we will
reconsider web support, which is postponed for the moment.</li>
</ul>


<p>Still, the tails-dev mailing list remains the main communication channel for
development and project-wide discussions.</p>

<p>This summit gave us the chance to <strong>evaluate and refine processes</strong> that we
have set up a year ago, such as our time-based release schedule and a formal
merge policy.</p>

<p>To end with, the <strong>public development meetings</strong> experiment will be
extended, and we will go on having monthly <strong>Low Hanging Fruits
sessions</strong>. Not only these sessions are very useful to make Tails better,
but we were happy to see new people join these parties recently. We hope to
see even more of that in the future: these sessions are great times to
<strong>start contributing</strong> to Tails!</p>

<h1>Hack</h1>

<p>Hours of meetings were certainly a necessary part of the summit, but we also
dedicated a fair share of our time to hands-on activities.  Fortunately
there is quite a lot of room for improvements in Tails, so we were never
left unoccupied.</p>

<p>The most noticeable technical change that happened during the summit was
perhaps <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails">our <strong>move to
Redmine</strong></a> for managing our
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=108">tasks</a>
and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/roadmap">plans</a>. We are not exploiting the full
potential of Redmine yet, but it already feels far less messy than how we
did previously. Hopefully this will help others get involved! Many thanks go
to Riseup for hosting the Redmine instance we use.  Note that we will keep
using ikiwiki for blueprints.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of Redmine, we have started classifying tasks in various
useful ways: e.g. <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=112"><strong>easy
tickets</strong></a>
do not require much knowledge of the Tails internals to be solved, and are
ideal places to get involved. In passing, other nice custom queries provide
lists of tasks involving
<a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=113">sysadmin</a>
and <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=115">web
development</a>.</p>

<p>We spent some time listing problems with early builds of <strong>Tails based on
Debian Wheezy</strong>. It is now clearer to us what remains to do: <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/6015">a few dozens tickets</a> were created. Did we mention that any
kind of help is warmly welcome? :)</p>

<p>Our <strong>Jenkins instance</strong> also had been taken care of: it is getting closer
to something we can use and rely upon as part of our daily workflow.</p>

<p>A lot of branches were <strong>merged for the upcoming 0.20 release</strong>, including
the installation of Dasher and a first step towards the replacement of
TrueCrypt.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pidgin and OTR documentation</strong> was
<a href="http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin.mdwn?h=doc/better-pidgin-and-otr-documentation">rewritten</a>
to be clearer and more precise, as well as our explanation of the way random
nicknames are generated for Pidgin accounts.</p>

<p>More steps have also been done towards <strong>not starting Iceweasel</strong> on
startup.</p>

<h1>At the end is the beginning</h1>

<p>As you can guess, this summit was as intense as the previous ones.  Tails is
living decisive times, so we expect the next year to be pretty
interesting. <em>You</em> can perhaps make the difference, so do not hesitate
<a href="../contribute.de.html">joining the dance</a>!</p>
