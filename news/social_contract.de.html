Announcing the Tails Social Contract

<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content" role="main">
<p>We had written and adopted a <a href="../contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct.html">Code of
Conduct</a> since our first public
hackfest in Paris in 2014. This code was and is meant as a guide to make our
public spaces welcoming and friendly to every sentient being.</p>

<p>We have since then worked on a <a href="../doc/about/social_contract.de.html">Social Contract</a>
which we proudly present today!</p>




<p>The Tails Social Contract is a set of commitments that we as
contributors to the Tails project stand by. This work is derived from
the Debian Social Contract and the Tor Social Contract. If you have any
questions or comments, feel free to email: <a href="mailto:tails-project@boum.org">tails-project@boum.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is a promise from our contributors community to the rest of the world,
affirming a commitment to our beliefs.</p>

<h2>1. By creating Tails we try to provide usable tools for anonymity and privacy</h2>

<p>We believe that privacy, the free exchange of ideas, and equal access to
information are essential to free and open societies. Through our community
standards and the tools we create, we provide means that empower all people
to protect and advance these ideals.</p>

<h2>2. Tails is and will remain free software</h2>

<p>Equal access to information includes the free availability of our code and
documentation as well as the transparency of our decision making processes.</p>

<p>All the components of Tails that we create ourselves are, and will be,
licensed in a manner consistent with the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Tails will always be free to use, remix, adapt and distribute.  As the only
exceptions to this rule, Tails includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a minor part of non-free firmware in order to work on as much hardware as
possible;</li>
<li>a few pieces of software whose source code is public but not compatible
with the Debian Free Software Guidelines; they are needed to support
important use cases.</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. We will give back to the Free Software community</h2>

<p>Tails is a privacy-oriented <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives">Debian
Derivative</a>.</p>

<p>We want usable security and privacy-oriented tools to become a standard for
the Free Software community as a whole.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, code improvements, Debian packaging, as well as work on usability
issues will be sent upstream whenever possible. This way, our modifications
will benefit others and can be improved upon further by a wider audience of
people.</p>

<h2>4. We encourage participation and transparency</h2>

<p>We want to produce Tails in a way that encourages participation, which
requires publicly documenting what can be improved.  As Tails is created in
such a transparent manner, anyone is encouraged to participate, review it
and point out problems.</p>

<p>To make our community a welcoming place for everybody we agreed on a <a href="../contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct.html">Code
of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2>5. We will never harm our users intentionally</h2>

<p>We will always do our best to create secure and usable tools. We will never
willingly include backdoors or malicious software nor will we cooperate with
any entity wanting us to harm our users.</p>

<p>Mistakes sometimes happen. We will be honest about them and fix those that
affect the safety of Tails users when they are reported to us.</p>

<p>Whenever severe security issues are reported to us in private, we will test
them and ensure we promptly fix these issues. We will notify our users
whenever such an issue has been reported to us. However, for the security of
our users, we might not disclose such a severe issue before releasing a fix.</p>

<h2>6. We give users the means to decide how much they can rely on Tails</h2>

<p>We encourage users to inform themselves and decide if Tails is suitable for
their use case and how much they can trust it. We work diligently to keep
our community up-to-date through our various communication channels about
the current state of our software and its limitations. We encourage users to
read our documentation as well as third-party documentation in order to make
an informed decision and engage in a learning process about the tools we
ship.</p>

<p>We provide and explain methods of verification so that anyone can ensure
that they downloaded a genuine copy of Tails.</p>
