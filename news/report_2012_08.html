<div id="content" role="main">
<p>Here is the report of the many things that happened around Tails in
August, 2012.</p>

<p>Tails has been started and successfully connected to the Tor network
around 64.000 times in August. That makes a boot every 41 seconds on
average. We know this since Tails checks if a new release is available
once the network is connected each boot.</p>

<h1>Releases</h1>

<p>Version 0.13 is coming! We have released the first
release candidate, along with a <a href="./test_0.13-rc1.html">call for testing</a>.</p>

<p>Unless something nasty happens, Tails 0.13 should be released on
September 11th.</p>

<h1>Tails summit</h1>

<p>Seven mighty Tails developers gathered for a ten-day summit, including a
day trip to the sea. The meeting was exhausting, inspiring and
productive. We have tied up some discussions that had a year long
history, made plans for the future, and worked on a few annoying bug
fixes and cool hacks.</p>

<p>So, what happened during Tails summit? (Not in any relevant order.)</p>

<ul>

the future of Tails.</li>

<li>Benchmarked several task managers.</li>
<li>Handled conspiranoia about our website.</li>
<li>Clarified our position and priorities regarding Tails&#39; network fingerprint,
both on the &quot;local&quot; side (ISP, local router) and &quot;remote&quot; side (Exit node,
web server).</li>
<li>Decided to accept Bitcoin donations (stay tuned!) but we still do not

how we will.</li>
<li>Discussed how we can make paid workers and volunteers (who sometimes are
the same persons, really) work together happily.</li>
<li>Clarified loooads of development processes so that we avoid the need for a
project manager, and know better how to get changes into Tails.
Expect us to fill the contribute section of the Tails website with that.</li>

<li>After some serious drifts we decided not writing anything anymore on
the &quot;done during the summit&quot; list.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Outreach and support</h1>

<p>As we would like to get more people to test our release candidates, we
decided to experiment with relaying our news on Twitter. You can follow
the project at <a href="https://twitter.com/Tails_live">https://twitter.com/Tails_live</a>.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that Twitter is inferior in terms of freedom to many
other Internet protocols and tools. But the content is public and will
be reserved for announcements. It feels like an acceptable trade-off to
spread our information where people read it.</p>

<p>Again, please note this is not a channel to contact us. We also have no
intents to spread on other medias that are dangerous in terms of
privacy, control, centralization and censorship. If you want to
contact us and hope to get a response, please use the proper
communication channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ones for <a href="../about/contact.en.html#tails-dev">public discussions</a>,</li>
<li>the ones for <a href="../support/talk.en.html">private contacts</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>We have received 40 reports sent using WhisperBack. Our receiving relay
was regularly offline this month due to hardware issue.</p>

<p>The forum received 639 new messages, 73 of them signed by &quot;Tails&quot;.</p>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>The following branches that had pending reviews were merged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using precompiled locales.</li>
<li>Incremental updates.</li>
<li>Support for live-boot 3.x.</li>
<li>WhisperBack 1.6 (see details bellow).</li>
</ul>


<p>Misc fixes and improvements that will show up in 0.13:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix the System Monitor applet by adding gnome-system-monitor.</li>
<li>Remove unused variables in htpdate.</li>
<li>Remove residual DHCP DNS settings from resolvconf.</li>
<li>Properly handle wireless per-country frequency regulation.</li>
<li>Hide the unusable &#39;TailsData&#39; volume from Nautilus.</li>
<li>ttdnsd is now out of the default name resolution loop. This
should fix hard to track resolution errors.</li>
<li>I2P has been updated to 0.9.1.</li>
</ul>


<p>The ikiwiki forum is not anymore in the bundled static website. This
results in an important build speed improvement.</p>

<p>A little more progress has been made on building Tails for the next
upcoming Debian release (codename Wheezy). See
<a href="http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/wheezy">wheezy</a> branch.</p>

<p>Started work on including Tor 0.2.3. This is targeted at 0.14. See
<a href="http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/feature/Tor_0.2.3">feature/Tor_0.2.3</a>
branch.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-August/001524.html">possible fix for the pause during the boot
process</a>
that probably appeared with Tails 0.12.</p>

<p>Some more sorting has been made in order to retrofit our custom packages
in our future APT repositories
and remove them from our Git repository.</p>

<p>WhisperBack, our encrypted bug reporting application got a lot of improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load help from the config file instead of hardcoding it</li>
<li>Sanitize debugging info</li>
<li>L10n: import translations for Arabic, Czech Spanish, Euskera, French, Dutch,
Polish, Portuguese and Russian</li>
<li>Improve UI especially for small screens</li>
<li>Use a dedicated GnuPG keyring</li>
</ul>

<h1>Translations</h1>

<p>We also received many patches for our custom programs in Russian, Arabic,
and Farsi.</p>

<h1>Funding</h1>

<p>We sent a proposal to sponsor <em>Bravo</em> about funding developers for October
and November to work on our user support channels, documentation and
hardware support.</p>
