<p>As you might have noticed, <a href="./report_2014_06-07.html">the last monthly
report</a> was a long time ago, because the people
who were doing them had really no time left. Somebody new finally takes
over, let&#39;s hope it lasts :)</p>

<p>So, here is a minimal report for the second half of 2014, the next ones
will be more complete.</p>

<h1>Releases</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="./version_1.1.1.html">Tails 1.1.1 was released on September 2, 2014.</a> (minor release)</li>
<li><a href="./version_1.2.html">Tails 1.2 was released on October 14, 2014.</a> (major release)</li>
<li><a href="./version_1.2.1.html">Tails 1.2.1 was released on December 3, 2014.</a> (minor release)</li>
<li><a href="./version_1.2.2.html">Tails 1.2.2 was released on December 15, 2014.</a> (special minor release for security reasons)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Code</h1>

<p>For details, see each release announcement. Notable changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1.1.1: I2P now needs to be enabled with
a boot option. We made this choice after <a href="../security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13.en.html">a security hole affected
I2P</a> ; this problem is now
fixed, but if any other is discovered in the future, it won&#39;t affect
Tails users who don&#39;t use I2P.</p></li>
<li><p>1.2: <a href="../doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser.en.html">Tor Browser</a> replaces the
previous Firefox + Torbutton setup. This allows us to work more
closely with Tor people and provide a more unified experience to the
user.</p></li>
<li><p>Several major applications are <a href="../contribute/design/application_isolation.html">confined with
AppArmor</a>. This improves the
overall security provided by Tails, and AppArmor work is going on to
confine more applications :)</p></li>
<li><p>1.2.1: finally remove
TrueCrypt. It was abandonned
upstream since a long time, and it&#39;s safer to use maintained, reviewed
encryption methods, like
<a href="../doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes.en.html">LUKS</a> (that&#39;s what the
<a href="../doc/first_steps/persistence.en.html">persistence</a> uses). You can still open
your TrueCrypt volumes, but we recommand you switch to LUKS volumes as
soon as possible.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Funding</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>We passed a <a href="./who_are_you_helping.en.html">call for donations</a> on our
website which was quite successful. Donations are still welcome though :)</p></li>
<li><p>The grant proposal that we submitted to the <a href="https://digitaldefenders.org/">Digital
Defenders</a> was approved. It will fund
part of our activity over 2015:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build our capacity to provide same-day security updates:

<ul>
<li>Increase the test coverage of our automated test suite to cover
most of our remaining manual tests.</li>
<li>Write automated tests for the new features to be developed during

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Buy dedicated hardware to allow core developers to be able to run
the test suite locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streamline the installation process for less tech-savvy people:

<ul>
<li>Have Tails Installer available in Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives.</li>
<li>Write a Firefox extension to automate the ISO verification at
download time.</li>
<li>Rework our download and installation instructions as a web
assistant to guide new users step-by-step through the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide one year of help desk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We submitted a full proposal to the <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/">Open Technology
Fund</a>. It passed a first round of
review and is now waiting for the approval of their final committee.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Outreach</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Several Tails contributors attended the
<a href="https://events.ccc.de/category/31c3/">31C3</a> in Hamburg. We held a
Tails table where many people came to ask questions, get Tails
installed, start to contribute or just say thank you. We even had some
origami folding moments :)</p></li>
<li><p>We passed a call for help on <a href="./windows_camouflage_jessie.en.html">porting Windows camouflage to GNOME
3.14</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Press &amp; Testimonials</h1>

<p>For more information concerning the second half of 2014, see <a href="../press.en.html">our press page</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2014-12-29: In <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6258_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412282030_-_reconstructing_narratives_-_jacob_-_laura_poitras.html#video">Reconstructive narratives</a>
at the 31th Chaos Communication Congress, Jacob Appelbaum and Laura
Poitras explained that properly implemented encryption technologies
such as Tor, Tails, GnuPG, OTR, and RedPhone are some of the only ones
that can blind the pervasive surveillance of the NSA. They are rated
as &quot;catastrophic&quot; by the NSA itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Tails is being used in the film
<a href="https://citizenfourfilm.com/">Citizenfour</a> by Laura Poitras and
appears in the credits.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Documentation</h1>

<ul>
<li>We documented a workaround to <a href="../doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop.en.html#empty-trash">empty the
trash</a> of the persistent volume.</li>
</ul>
