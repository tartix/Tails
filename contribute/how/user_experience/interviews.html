<p>We are collecting here summaries and insights from interviews
with Tails users.</p>

<p>For privacy reasons, the name and organization of the interviewees were
changed, the interviews were translated and slightly rephrased, and the
interviewees reviewed the text before publication.</p>

<p>In their shortest form, these can be
<a href="http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/framework-elements/intercept-interviews/">intercept Interviews</a>
that are designed to increase understanding and dialogue through a series of
quick questions that take no more than 10 to 15 minutes of dialogue.</p>

<p>The email address of the interviewees are stored in the internal Git
repo: <code>contacts/ux_interviews.mdwn</code>.</p>

<p>The names of the interviewees are changed but loosely related in terms
of gender, language, and age.</p>

<h2>Resources on interviewing users</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=steve+portigal+interviewing+users">Steve Portigal, <em>Interviewing Users</em></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gkarsay.github.io/parlatype/">Parlatype</a>, a minimal audio
player for manual speech transcription.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Tips when taking notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, try to transcribe the language, mental model, and
understanding of the interviewee. The interviewee might use a
different word than what we usual use (for example, &quot;permanent&quot;
instead of &quot;persistent&quot;) or think that something is not possible in
Tails while it is. Don&#39;t correct them during the interview (you can
clarify things that could be helpful for them at the very end) and
transcribe this in your summary.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Template email for validating the output</h2>

<pre>
Thank you so much for taking some time to answer my questions about
Tails the other day!

I&#39;m sending you here what I plan to store in our public working
documents on our website. Please correct me if I misunderstood
something or if you want me to remove some bits.
