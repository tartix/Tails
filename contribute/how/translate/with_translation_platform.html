<p>The Tails website, which includes the Tails <a href="../../../doc.en.html">documentation</a>, can
be translated using the <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org">Tails translation
platform</a>. Using this platform is
easy: you are not required to set up complicated tools to start
translating.</p>

<p>The Tails translation platform is an instance of
<a href="https://weblate.org/">Weblate</a>, and the full documentation for
translators is available on the <a href="https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/translating.html">Weblate translators
guide</a>.</p>

<p>Below you will find instructions on how to get started translating the
Tails website.</p>

<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>Create and configure an account</h1>

<p>You don&#39;t need an account on the translation platform to suggest translations.
On the other hand, if you want to vote for suggestions, use a dashboard for
a better translation workflow, and eventually request to become a reviewer,
then you do need to create an account.</p>

<p>Steps to create and configure an account:</p>

<ol>
<li>Access the <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/accounts/register/">registration
page</a>, fill the form
with an <strong>E-mail</strong> address, a <strong>Username</strong>, a <strong>Full name</strong> and the answer
to the mathematical question to prove you&#39;re not a spammer robot. There&#39;s
no need to use your real name here, you can even repeat the username in the
full name field. Then, click the <strong>Register</strong> button.</li>
<li>Check your e-mail inbox, you should receive a message by
<strong>root@lizard.tails.boum.org</strong> with a verification link to activate
your account. Access that link and choose a new passphrase for your
account. You should leave the <strong>Current password</strong> field empty if you have
just activated the account and it&#39;s the first time you set up a password
for this account.</li>
<li>Configure the <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/accounts/profile/#languages">languages</a>
you want to work with in the translation platform. The languages you select
in <strong>Translated languages</strong> will
appear on your dashboard so it&#39;s easier for you to access
them. <strong>Secondary languages</strong> will be shown as references during
translation to try and make your work easier. Then, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Configure your <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/accounts/profile/#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.
Subscribe to Tails and you can also subscribe to receive notificacions
if there are new strings to translate.</li>
</ol>


<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Explore the translation platform</h1>

<p>On the Tails translation platform, a <em>translation component</em> corresponds to
one page of the Tails website. For example, the page <a href="../../../contribute.en.html">contribute</a> can be
translated <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/projects/tails/contribute/">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>The Dashboard</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/"><strong>Dashboard</strong></a> is the first page that
appears when you log in to the Tails translation platform. It offers different
views of translation components for the languages you have configured. It
contains a series of useful tabs, in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/#your-subscriptions">Watched translations</a>
:</strong> lists the projects you have selected to watch. As this instance has only
one project, Tails, this view is not very useful for now.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/#your-languages">Your languages</a>:</strong> lists
all components registered in the platform for your configured languages.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/#suggestions">Suggested translations</a>:</strong>
lists a bunch of untranslated components suggested to you by the Weblate
platform.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/#list-core">Core pages</a>:</strong> lists the most
important components to be translated, as selected by the Tails team.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> lists components of the <em>Persistent Storage</em>
section of the Tails documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Install &amp; upgrade:</strong> lists components of the <em>Download and install
Tails</em> section of the Tails website.</li>
<li><strong>First steps:</strong> lists components of the <em>First steps with Tails</em>
section of the Tails documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous internet:</strong> lists components of the <em>Connect to the
Internet anonymously</em> section of the Tails documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Insights:</strong> gives you access to the history, activity and statistics
of the translation platform.</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> gives you access to search, <a href="#checks">checks for strings</a> and
other information about the contents of the Tails translation platform.</li>
</ul>


<p>In all tabs that list translation components, you will see the same columns
with information about each of the listed components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Project:</strong> lists the full name of the component, which should match
it&#39;s place in the Tails repository.</li>
<li><strong>Translated:</strong> shows the percentage of strings in the component that
are already translated.</li>
<li><strong>Words:</strong> shows the percentage of words in the component that are
already translated.</li>
<li><strong>Needs Review:</strong> shows the percentage of strings in the component that are
waiting for review.</li>
<li><strong>Checks:</strong> shows the number of strings in the component that the
system identified as needing to be verified. The list of things to
check will appear in the component view on top of the right column.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions:</strong> shows the number of strings in the component that
have suggestions that need to be evaluated.</li>
</ul>


<p>As you move around and start translating, each of the above will become more
clear.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>Translation components</h2>

<p>As stated above, a <em>translation component</em> in the Tails translation platform
corresponds to the translation of one page of the Tails website to a specific
language. A <em>component overview</em> gives access to the translation status of
that component and the strings that need to be checked.</p>

<p>To access a <em>component overview</em>, start from the Dashboard, select one of the
tabs (as explained in the previous section), and click the name of the
component in the left column of the components table. From the component
overview page, you can go to the different translation pages for untranslated
strings, strings marked as needing editing, strings with suggestions, etc. You can
also go directly from the Dashboard to the different translation pages of
a component by clicking on the links on the other columns of the component
table.</p>

<p>Find your way around. The translation platform might look a bit full of
corners at first, but once you get used to the different ways through
which you can reach the translation workflow you&#39;ll start getting
translation work done.</p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Translation workflow</h1>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>Suggest translations and approve suggestions</h2>

<p>On the Tails translation platform, you can always <em>suggest</em> a new
translation, and if you are reviewer you can also <em>accept</em> an already suggested
translation. There is no way to directly save your translation.
<em>This is intentional</em>, to make sure that
mandatory peer review happens before new translations get accepted.
Suggestions have to be accepted by reviewers to go live onto the main Tails
website.</p>

<p>In order to <em>suggest</em> a new translation, access a component translation page as
described in the last section, fill or modify the <strong>Translation</strong> field in the
<em>Translate</em> box, and then click <strong>Suggest</strong>. You will be automatically taken to
the next string in the list that you are currently accessing.</p>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Tips to translate</h3>

<ul>
<li>While translating is useful to look in the <em>Machine translation</em> tab, which
shows suggestions from Weblate&#39;s internal &quot;translation memory&quot;. Using the same
expressions helps to have consistency through the whole website.</li>
<li>If you are not sure about how to translate a string, you can look into the <em>Other
languages</em> tab to see how translators for other languages have translated it.</li>
<li>Open the different versions of the page you are translating (the staging
website version, and if the language is already enabled, the main website)
so you can see the actual result of the translations and spot errors more
easily.</li>
<li>If the page mentions applications and menus, open them while translating and
make sure you use the same words.</li>
<li>Use the glossary while translating: words in the glossary will appear beside
the string window while you translate. To use the translation of the glossary
you can click on it, and the word will be copied to the translation window.
Add new words and their translation to the glossary when you think they are
useful.</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="preview"> </a></p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Preview translations using the staging website</h2>

<p>A preview or <a href="https://staging.tails.boum.org/">staging website</a> that builds daily
is available and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most recent version of the main Tails website.</li>
<li>A larger number of languages than the ones active on the main website,</li>
<li>All most voted suggestions made through the translation platform, choosing
the most recent one when there are many suggestions with the same number of
votes.</li>
</ul>


<p>With this, everyone can see how the most recent suggestions look
like before they go live on the Tails website.</p>

<p>Beware, the staging website is visually indifferent from the Tails main
website.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>Reviewers</h2>

<p>Reviewers are users that can accept suggestions. A request to become a
reviewer can be sent to the <a href="../translate.html#follow-up">mailing list for
translators</a>. An administrator will verify
that a reasonable amount of work was done by the requesting translator
before the request is accepted.</p>

<p>To be a good reviewer it is necessary to fulfill these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to communicate with others, solve conflicts.</li>
<li>A desire to help potentially inexpert translators to improve without losing
your patience, as many of our translators have no previous translation
experience.</li>
<li>Be confident navigating our website, its contents, know <a href="../../build/website.html">how to compile a local
version on your computer</a>.</li>
<li>Have some knowledge of HTML because it is used in some strings.</li>
<li>Have some knowledge of Ikiwiki and its functions like inline pages, to be able
to find the pages where translations will appear.</li>
<li>Understand what is Tails, use it, being able to test the documentation you
are reviewing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Reviewers are asked to not bypass the review process for their own work,
except perhaps to fix obvious and important problems. This means that as
a reviewer, for your own translations you should also use the
<em>suggestion</em> feature.</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Accept suggestions</h3>

<p>In order to <em>accept</em> suggestions, find a component with
suggestions in the Dashboard and either click directly in the number of
suggestions in the component list or access the component overview page and
then click <em>Strings with suggestions</em>. You will be taken to the respective
component translation page. In the tabs below the <em>Translate</em> box, click
<strong>Suggestions</strong>, and you&#39;ll be presented with a list of suggestions for that
string. Evaluate the suggestion carefully, and then choose to either <em>Accept</em>
, <em>Accept and edit</em>, or <em>Delete</em>.</p>

<h4><a name="index1h4"></a>Tips to review suggestions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Open the different versions of the page you are reviewing (the staging
website version, and if the language is already enabled, the main website)
so you can see the actual result of the translations and spot errors more
easily.</li>
<li>If the page mentions applications and menus open them while reviewing to
make sure that the translations use the same words.</li>
<li>If a suggestion has a small error, click on &#39;Accept and edit&#39;, correcting
the suggestion instead of deleting it. This way, the work of the first
translator will be recorded.</li>
<li>If you notice that a new translator is making the same errors consistently,
contact him or her in private and explain nicely the error and how it can be
prevented.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="checks"><a name="index3h3"></a>Review translation checks</h3>


<p>The translation platform performs many checks on the strings.
These checks are available from the <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/checks/"><em>Tools</em> tab in the
Dashboard</a>. The most important checks
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/checks/end_newline/tails/">Trailing
newline</a>:
When the source and translated strings differ on the number of new lines at
their end, <em>the website breaks</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/checks/inconsistent/tails/">Inconsistent</a>:
This check indicates when a string has more than one translation in the
project. Having the same translations along the website is important for the
consistency of the documentation. This check also helps to reuse translations
of strings that appear in different pages.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index4h1"></a>Request the activation of a new language</h1>

<p>The activation of a new language on the translation platform has to be
requested through the <a href="../translate.html#follow-up">mailing list for
translators</a>. Have in mind that it
is suggested to have a team of translators to <a href="./team/new.html">translate the Tails
website into a new language</a>, as the
website is updated very often and it is not feasible to keep it up to date if
you are only one person.</p>

<p>Maintaining a <a href="https://translate.tails.boum.org/dictionaries/tails/">glossary</a>
within the team is also advisable: this will help giving consistency to the
translations, making them easier to understand.</p>

<p>A language enabled in our translation platform <strong>will not</strong> automatically show
up on the main Tails website, only on the <a href="#preview">staging
website</a>.</p>

<p>A new language can only be activated on the main <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails
website</a> when at least <a href="./team/new.html">25% of the core pages
have been translated</a>. And by
translated we mean: translated and accepted by a reviewer. Once that is
the case, the activation of a new language on the main Tails website has
to be requested through the <a href="../translate.html#follow-up">mailing list for
translators</a>.</p>

<p><a id="getting-help"> </a></p>
