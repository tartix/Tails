<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>Background</h1>

<p>&hellip; where the reader learns why this page is even needed and a few
relevant facts they should be aware of.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>APT repositories</h2>

<p>Tails is built using a combination of snapshots of the Debian archive
and overlay APT suites. This greatly impact the timeline and processes
of upgrading any Debian package in Tails, and in particular the Linux
kernel. This document assumes a good understanding of this <a href="./APT_repository.html">somewhat
complex system</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>The Debian side of things</h2>

<p>We generally ship the latest Linux kernel from Debian <em>stable backports</em>, and
occasionally from <em>unstable</em> when a critical security fix is not available in
<em>stable backports</em> yet.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel binary packages include an ABI version number, e.g.
for <code>linux-image-4.18.0-2-amd64</code> the ABI is version 2.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the only way to include security fixes is to
upgrade Linux to a major new version. For example, say the current
Tails release includes Linux 5.18.8, an important security issue was
fixed in 5.18.9 and in 5.19.6. If 5.19.6 was uploaded to <em>unstable</em>
but 5.18.9 never was, then our only option to include this security
fix is to upgrade to 5.19.6.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a><em>We</em> need to decide</h2>

<p>Which exact Linux kernel version we ship in a given Tails release is
a trade-off between packages availability, security fixes, limiting
the risks of hardware support regressions, and adding support for new
hardware. The Foundations Team has to make this decision
during every Tails release cycle. Due to the way we manage our APT
repositories and to the fact we don&#39;t publish release candidates for
Tails bugfix releases, how this decision is made and implemented
depends in great part on what kind of Tails release is upcoming (major
or bugfix).</p>

<p>The <code>KERNEL_VERSION</code> variable in <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/amnesia">config/amnesia</a>
determines what version of the kernel will be installed during the
build. This includes the ABI version number, so even our <code>devel</code>
branch does not get Linux point-release (e.g. 4.19.7) upgrades
automatically if the ABI is bumped.</p>

<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Process</h1>

<p>A Foundations Team member (generally the team lead, so far) creates
a tracking issue whenever:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new major version of Linux is released. At this point, that
version is generally available only in Debian <em>experimental</em>.</li>
<li>A Linux point-release (e.g. 4.19.7) that includes potentially
relevant security fixes or changes the ABI is uploaded to Debian
<em>unstable</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once this new kernel is available in our APT snapshots a Foundations
Team member (you!) gathers the data that will inform our decision.
There are two aspects to it: how it works for us and what the
risk/benefit of the upgrade is.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Test the new kernel</h2>

<p>To learn how the new kernel works for us:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork a branch off <code>devel</code> called
<code>NNNNN-linux-X.Y+force-all-tests</code>.</li>
<li>Adjust <code>KERNEL_VERSION</code> in <code>config/amnesia</code>. If <code>KERNEL_VERSION</code> is
unchanged (point-release without ABI bump), then this branch is
identical to <code>devel</code> and its only purpose is to force Jenkins to
run our entire test suite (<code>+force-all-tests</code>). But since this
branch has no commit on top of <code>devel</code>, Jenkins will ignore it, so
you need to create a dummy commit.</li>
<li>Push this new branch to our CI.</li>
<li>Quickly test a build from this branch on your hardware.</li>
<li>Compare the Jenkins build and test results to the ones for our
<code>stable</code> and <code>devel</code> branch.</li>
<li>Report your findings on the issue.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>Gather other data that will inform our decision</h2>

<p>Take notes on the issue of the most relevant bits, or lack thereof,
for:</p>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Security issues fixed since the version we currently ship</h3>

<p>To do so, look for &quot;CVE&quot; in the
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/raw/sid/debian/changelog">Changelog</a>
entries newer than the kernel we currently ship.</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Major security fixes still not fixed in the version we&#39;re considering</h3>

<p>(in which case, depending on when we are in our own release process,
it may be worth delaying the analysis a bit, or exceptionally installing
the kernel from <em>unstable</em>)</p>

<p>To do so, use the Debian <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/linux">security tracker for
Linux</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="index3h3"></a>Important regressions</h3>

<p>&hellip; i.e. bugs with severity <em>important</em> or higher recently reported to Debian against this version of the kernel.</p>

<p>To do so, in the <a href="https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=sid&amp;merged=ign&amp;fnewerval=7&amp;flastmodval=7&amp;packages=linux&amp;cseverity=1&amp;sortby=id&amp;sorto=desc&amp;format=html#results">Debian
BTS</a>,
look for bugs with severity <em>important</em> or higher that satisfy one of these
criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>the bug title includes the kernel version we&#39;re considering upgrading to</li>
<li>the bug was reported very recently (the bug title may not say
what kernel version is affected, but once you open the bug&#39;s page,
you&#39;ll see that info; for example, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/960871">Debian bug #960871</a> is marked
as affecting linux/5.6.7-1)</li>
</ul>


<p>If there are important hardware support regressions, ask someone who has an
archive of WhisperBack reports (for example intrigeri) to check the
popularity <em>in Tails</em> of the affected hardware: while assessing the impact of
regressions, we need to take into account that some devices are much more
popular among Tails users than among the general Debian users population.</p>

<h3><a name="index4h3"></a>Relevant hardware support improvements</h3>

<p>To get a rough guts feeling about it, look for improvements related to graphics
cards and Wi-Fi adapters support while skimming over:</p>

<ul>
<li>the &quot;Drivers&quot; section of Kernelnewbies&#39;s <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges">human-readable
changelog</a> of upstream changes
(only relevant for a new major Linux release)</li>
<li>the Debian package&#39;s
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/raw/sid/debian/changelog">Changelog</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>Make a decision</h2>

<p>With all the information you gathered earlier, use your best judgement
to make a decision. The kind of decision you need to make depends on
several factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the upcoming Tails release is a major one and upgrading the
kernel did not require modifying <code>KERNEL_VERSION</code>, then if we do
nothing particular, our next release will get the upgrade. So you
need to decide whether this kernel upgrade is bad enough for us to
opt-out, or important enough for us to fix whatever regressions it
may bring. In practice, opting-out of the upgrade is rarely the
best choice but YMMV.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, upgrading Linux in our next release will require work,
so you need to decide whether the overall cost/benefit of the
upgrade is worth it, factoring in the work needed and all the data
you&#39;ve gathered earlier.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If in doubt, ask your team-mates :)</p>

<p>If the decision is &quot;do nothing&quot;, close the issue and stop reading here.
Else, read on.</p>

<h2><a name="index7h2"></a>Implement the decision</h2>

<p>How to implement the decision depends on what kind of Tails release is
upcoming.</p>

<h3><a name="index5h3"></a>Bugfix release</h3>

<p>The branch you&#39;ve used so far to get results from our CI was forked
off <code>devel</code> so it&#39;s not a valid candidate for merging into <code>stable</code>.
Therefore, create a new
<code>NNNNN-linux-X.Y-stable+force-all-tests</code> topic branch forked
off <code>stable</code> and transplant onto it the commits you had to create on
your <code>devel</code>-based topic branch (<code>git rebase --onto</code> or <code>git
cherry-pick</code>).</p>

<p>But the new resulting topic branch will likely not build: a bugfix
release is built from our <code>stable</code> branch, that uses a set of APT
snapshots frozen during the last major release process, and these old
snapshots probably don&#39;t include the version of the kernel you want to
upgrade to. So there are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either bump the APT snapshot of the <code>debian</code> archive to the oldest
one that includes this new kernel. When it can reasonably be done,
this is the cheapest option so it&#39;s worth trying it first:</p>

<ol>
<li>Update <code>config/APT_snapshots.d/debian/serial</code>, commit, push and
trigger a build on Jenkins.</li>
<li>Compare the <code>.build-manifest</code> and <code>.packages</code> files generated
by building your topic branch with <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/tree/master/wiki/src/torrents/files">the
ones for the current Tails release</a>.</li>
<li>If the diff seems reasonable, fine. Otherwise, fall back to the
next option (freeze exception).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Or use our <a href="./APT_repository/time-based_snapshots.html#design-freeze-exceptions">freeze
exception</a>
mechanism i.e. import the new Linux packages into a dedicated
overlay suite in our custom APT repository and make your topic
branch use it.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The CI results you got with your previous topic branch based on
<code>devel</code> are not valid for your new branch: the new kernel may work
fine in the former case thanks to corresponding userspace changes, but
cause trouble in the context of our <code>stable</code> branch. So push your
branch to our CI, trigger a build in Jenkins and analyze the
test results. Once happy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow our usual process to get it reviewed and merged.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to <a href="./Linux_kernel.html#new-security-features">enable new security
features</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="index6h3"></a>Major release</h3>

<p>If you decided to opt-out from a kernel upgrade we would otherwise
automatically include: piggy-back on our <a href="./APT_repository/time-based_snapshots.html#design-freeze-exceptions">freeze
exception</a>
mechanism to force the installation of an older kernel.</p>

<p>Else, you&#39;re trying to upgrade the kernel. It turns out you already
have prepared the very topic branch we need to do that, so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow our usual process to get it reviewed and merged.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to <a href="./Linux_kernel.html#new-security-features">enable new security
features</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p><a id="new-security-features"></a></p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Enable new security features</h1>

<p>This section assumes we have decided to upgrade to a major new version
of Linux.</p>

<p>Major new kernel versions often bring new security features.
After each major kernel release, Kees Cook publishes on
<a href="https://outflux.net/blog/">his blog</a> an article titled
&quot;security things in Linux $VERSION&quot; about these improvements.</p>

<p>What you need to do depends on what it takes to benefit from each such
improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Enabled by default: nothing to do, profit :)</p></li>
<li><p>Guarded by local configuration such as a sysctl or a kernel command
line option: file a GitLab issue about it, with the
<code>Core work: Foundations Team</code> label.
Optionally, do the work yourself:
once you&#39;ve got CI results about your topic branch with this new
option disabled, add a commit that enables it and compare the
results (including test suite total run time, to spot important
performance regressions).</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be enabled at kernel configuration time: check if it&#39;s
been enabled in the Debian kernel; if it&#39;s not been enabled there
yet and enabling it would make sense in a general-purpose distro
kernel where UX breakage and performance regressions can be serious
problems, file a wishlist bug against the <code>linux</code> source package.
Point to Kees&#39; post and explain why you think it&#39;s worth it.</p></li>
</ul>
