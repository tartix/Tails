<h1><a name="index1h1"></a>DNS</h1>

<p>Tor does not support UDP so we cannot simply redirect DNS queries to
the Tor transparent proxy.</p>

<p>Most DNS leaks are avoided by having the system resolver query
the Tor network using the <code>DNSPort</code> configured in
<code>torrc</code>.</p>

<p>There is a concern that any application could attempt to do its own
DNS resolution without using the system resolver; UDP datagrams are
therefore blocked in order to prevent leaks. Another solution may be
to use the Linux network filter to forward outgoing UDP datagrams to
the local DNS proxy.</p>

<p>Tails also forbids DNS queries to RFC1918 addresses; those might
indeed allow the system to learn the local network&#39;s public IP
address.</p>

<p><code>resolv.conf</code> is configured to point to the Tor DNS resolver, and <span class="application">NetworkManager<span> and <code>dhclient</code> are configured
not to manage <code>resolv.conf</code> at all:</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/disable_make_resolv_conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/disable make resolv conf</a></li>

</ul>


<p>Some applications need to be able to do clearnet DNS resolutions, so
we save the DNS configuration obtained by NetworkManager:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/00-resolv-over-clearnet">config/chroot local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/00-resolv-over-clearnet</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The following is the complete list of the applications allowed to use
the clearnet DNS configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>tor</code> process itself, but only if the user requested to
configure Tor&#39;s network settings in the Welcome Screen; in this case
<code>tor</code> being able to resolve hostnames is convenient (e.g. hostnames
are human-readable, IP addresses not as much) or even necessary
(e.g. for the Meek pluggable transport):

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-tor.sh">config/chroot local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-tor.sh</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the <code>clearnet</code> user used to run the
<a href="./Unsafe_Browser.html">Unsafe Browser</a>:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser">config/chroot local-includes/usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="index2h1"></a>Network filter</h1>

<p>One serious security issue is that we don&#39;t know what software will
attempt to contact the network and whether their proxy settings are
set up to use the Tor SOCKS proxy correctly.
This is solved by blocking all outbound Internet traffic except Tor,
and explicitly configuring all applications to use one of
these.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf</a>
(uses <a href="http://ferm.foo-projects.org/">ferm</a> to build an <code>iptables</code>
ruleset)</li>
</ul>


<p>The default case is to block all outbound network traffic; let us now
document all exceptions and some clarifications to this rule.</p>

<h4><a name="index1h4"></a>Tor user</h4>

<p>Tor itself obviously has to connect to the Internet without going
through the Tor network. This is achieved by special-casing
connections originating from the <code>debian-tor</code> Unix user.</p>

<h4><a name="index2h4"></a>Unsafe Browser and the <code>clearnet</code> user</h4>

<p>The <code>clearnet</code> user used to run the
<a href="./Unsafe_Browser.html">Unsafe Browser</a> is granted full network access
(but no loopback access) in order to deal with captive portals.</p>

<h4><a name="index3h4"></a>Local Area Network (LAN)</h4>

<p>Tails short description talks of sending through Tor <em>outgoing
connections to the Internet</em>. Indeed: traffic to the local LAN
(RFC1918 addresses) is wide open as well as the loopback traffic
obviously.</p>

<p>LAN DNS queries are forbidden to protect against some attacks.</p>

<h4><a name="index4h4"></a>Local services whitelist</h4>

<p>The Tails firewall uses a whitelist which only grants access to each
local service to the users that actually need it. This blocks
potential leaks due to misconfigurations or bugs, and deanonymization
attacks by compromised processes. For specifics, see the firewall
configuration where this is well commented:
<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf</a></p>

<h4><a name="index5h4"></a>Automapped addresses</h4>

<p><code>AutomapHostsOnResolve</code> is enabled in Tor configuration, and
a firewall rule transparently redirects to the Tor transparent proxy
port the connections targeted at the <code>127.192.0.0/10</code> virtual mapped
address space.</p>

<p>Only the <code>amnesia</code> user is granted access to the Tor transparent proxy
port, so in practice only this user can use this hostname-to-address
mapping facility.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/tor/torrc">config/chroot local-includes/etc/tor/torrc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/ferm/ferm.conf</a></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index6h4"></a>IPv6</h4>

<p>Tor does not support IPv6 yet so IPv6 communication is blocked.</p>

<h4><a name="index7h4"></a>UDP, ICMP and other non-TCP protocols</h4>

<p>Tor only supports TCP. Non-TCP traffic to the Internet, such as UDP
datagrams and ICMP packets, is dropped.</p>

<p>An unfortunate consequence of fully blocking ICMP is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path%20MTU%20Discovery">Path MTU Discovery</a> is broken. We workaround this problem by enabling
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4821.txt">Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery</a>.
For details, see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/commit/1d1c83d">1d1c83d</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/sysctl.d/pmtud.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/sysctl.d/pmtud.conf</a></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index8h4"></a><code>RELATED</code> packets</h4>

<p>As a general rule, the Tails&#39; firewall does not accept <code>RELATED</code>
packets: accepting them enables quite a lot of code in the kernel that
we don&#39;t need, so we prefer reducing the attack surface a bit by
blocking them. See the &quot;[Tails-dev] Reducing attack surface of kernel
and tightening firewall/sysctls&quot; thread for details.</p>

<p>However, <code>RELATED</code> ICMP packets to the loopback interface are let
through, in order to smooth user experience whenever a program&#39;s local
network connection is blocked, and the TCP stack generates ICMP
packets (e.g. with <code>TYPE=3 CODE=3</code>, i.e. the destination port is
unreachable) to let the program know what is going on early, instead
of letting it wait for a timeout.</p>

<h4><a name="index9h4"></a>netfilter&#39;s connection tracking helpers</h4>

<p>We disable netfilter&#39;s automatic conntrack helper assignment
(<code>nf_conntrack_helper</code>), that would otherwise enable a lot of code in
the Linux kernel that
<a href="https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/">parses incoming network packets, which seems potentially unsafe</a>
compared to the little gain it brings in the use case of Tails:</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/modprobe.d/no-conntrack-helper.conf">config/chroot local-includes/etc/modprobe.d/no-conntrack-helper.conf</a></p>

<h1><a name="index3h1"></a>Other non-Tor traffic</h1>

<p>When the user <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/network_connection#consent-question">allows Tails to connect to Tor
automatically</a>,
they consent to Tails initiating Internet activity without going through Tor, in
order to help them connect to Tor.</p>

<p>This can be useful, for example, to set the clock correctly or detect
captive portals.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Here are the criteria we are taking into account when we design and implement
such non-Tor Internet activity:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do our best even when we can&#39;t be perfect: take into account less advanced
adversaries too</p>

<p>We should do our best to make it less obvious to less advanced adversaries,
for example home/work surveillance (such as abusive partner or parents), even when
we can&#39;t protect against more advanced ones (such as the ISP).</p></li>
<li><p>Try to blend in: make the &quot;anonymity set&quot; as large as possible</p>

<p>For example, if the best we can do is to look somewhat like a Fedora/Ubuntu
user who has tor installed, it&#39;s already useful against some adversaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple to avoid maintenance churn</p>

<p>Whenever we try to emulate the behavior of another piece of software than
Tails in order to blend in, we should emulate software that we can understand
easily and that does not change its behavior too often.</p></li>
<li><p>Take into account connection patterns</p>

<p>Two connections in a row or more to the same organization or hosting service
may be more identifiable than 1 single connection, by said organization or by
the user&#39;s ISP. So we should try to get as much information as we can from
every such connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid services in a position to aggregate lots of data</p>

<p>Omnipresent Internet actors, such as the NSA, Google, AWS, or Cloudflare, can
correlate Tails&#39; non-Tor activity with other data they aggregate. We should
try to make it non-trivial to such adversaries that the connection is coming
from a Tails user, to make such correlation more difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>Use reliable services</p>

<p>We&#39;re doing non-Tor connections in order to improve UX. If these connections
rely on unreliable services, then we either have to take the risk that we&#39;ll
get users confused, or spend more time of software design, development, and
maintenance, in order to deal with the unreliability. Both outcomes are
problematic, so we should try to connect to reliable services.</p>

<p>In passing, note that falling back to another service when the first attempted
one is unreliable, can be used as an identifiable pattern by both passive and
active adversaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on users who chose to configure Tor automatically</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this whole reasoning only makes sense in the context of
a user who chose to configure Tor automatically, and allowed Tails to initiate
non-torified Internet connection to facilitate this. The situations in which
the user instead chose to hide Tor are out of scope here.</p>

<p>To illustrate with our <a href="../personas.html">personas</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kim definitely has to hide Tor from home or school
&rArr; out of scope</li>
<li>Riou and Cris might choose autoconfig or hide Tor depending on the context:

<ul>
<li>Cris should autoconnect when connecting from a domestic airport.</li>
<li>Riou might hide Tor when connecting from home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>And then, when reasoning about such non-torified connections, we should focus
on the cases when we recommend autoconfig: public networks or popular Tor
usage for circumvention.</p></li>
<li><p>Take into account subjective perception by users</p>

<p>Some options may trigger bad feelings in users, which in some cases cannot be
justified by a mere security analysis, because technically they would be the
better choice to protect users. It does matter how safe users feel when they
use Tails or consider to do so.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>Case studies</h2>

<p>Here we evaluate a few candidate services that we might want to connect to,
to see how they perform regarding to the above guidelines.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: there&#39;s no solution that perfectly follows all of our guidelines
so the decision will primarily depend on which threat models we want to optimize
for, that is our product strategy.</p>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Time synchronization</h3>

<h4><a name="index10h4"></a>Candidates</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Google captive portal detection: only fails the &quot;aggregation&quot; guideline</p>

<p>&rArr; perfect except when Google is a relevant adversary in the user&#39;s threat model</p></li>
<li><p>Fedora&#39;s <em>NetworkManager</em> captive portal detection</p>

<p>Run by Red Hat, some of it at AWS: only fails the &quot;aggregation&quot; guideline to
some degree (Amazon can get the same data, and does not see the HTTP
implementation details, but is probably less motivated to do so than Google).</p>

<p>&rArr; On the one hand it&#39;s somewhat better than Google wrt. aggregation. On the
other hand, the anonymity set is smaller when the ISP or home/work
surveillance are relevant adversaries, since the DNS request is
Fedora-specific.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian&#39;s <em>NetworkManager</em> captive portal detection (<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/network%2Dmanager%2Dconfig%2Dconnectivity%2Ddebian">network-manager-config-connectivity-debian</a>):
only fails the &quot;blend in&quot; guideline: has very few users (0.5% of Debian NetworkManager users according to popcon)</p>

<p>&rArr; Bad if the ISP or home/work surveillance are relevant adversaries.
Better than Riseup on all counts.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="index11h4"></a>Dismissed options</h4>

<p>We determined that each of these candidate options are strictly worse than
another one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get the time from Riseup via a HTTPS request to https://riseup.net/canary (HTP)</p>

<ul>
<li>fails the &quot;connection pattern&quot; guideline: short lived connection,
not fetching related web resources &rArr; we don&#39;t blend into any existing
anonymity set, be it from the ISP&#39;s perspective, or from Riseup&#39;s</li>
<li>reliability: good but not spotless; would perhaps not be a blocker
if it were the only issue</li>
</ul>


<p>&rArr; Very bad if the ISP or home/work surveillance are relevant adversaries.</p>

<p>Dismissed: worse than Debian&#39;s <em>NetworkManager</em> captive portal detection on all counts</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu&#39;s <em>NetworkManager</em> captive portal detection:
connectivity-check.ubuntu.com points to 3 Google IP addresses,
so it leaks more info to the ISP, home/work surveillance, and Google,
than to using Google&#39;s captive portal detection page directly</p>

<p>Dismissed: worse than Google on all counts</p></li>
<li><p>Firefox&#39; captive portal detection</p>

<ul>
<li>harder to track (internal implementation detail of Firefox, rather than
a public API&#39;ish setup like NM) &rarr; fails &quot;Keep it simple&quot;. But at the moment
it&#39;s just a document containing the string &quot;success&quot;</li>
<li>detectportal.firefox.com &rarr; AWZ and Google IP addresses &rarr; fails the
&quot;aggregation&quot; guideline</li>
<li>Firefox uses NSS so emulating it is not a curl/wget call away, but probably
not too hard either.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dismissed: worse than using either Google directly (DNS requests yield
a smaller anonymity set) or Fedora@AWS (harder to implement and maintain)</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu/Fedora NTP pool</p>

<ul>
<li>cleartext, no authentication &rArr; the ISP can replay an old, bad, Tor consensus</li>
<li>only gives us the time &rArr; if we have to do another connection to detect
captive portals anyway, we can get the time from that other connection (via
HTP), and then there&#39;s no reason to do NTP on top. This could become
a candidate again if we decided to implement time synchronization without
captive portal detection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>Currently implemented</h2>

<p>At the time we&#39;re writing this, no such background non-torified
Internet connection is implemented in current Tails.</p>
