<p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Tails team and community is
made up of a mixture of people from all over the world, working on every
aspect of the mission &mdash; including mentorship, teaching, and
connecting people. The commitments that we stand by as a community are
described in the
<a href="../../doc/about/social_contract.en.html">Tails Social Contract</a>.</p>

<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground
rules that we ask people to adhere to when they&#39;re participating within
this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders,
mentors and those seeking help and guidance.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an exhaustive list of things that you can&#39;t do. Rather, take
it in the spirit in which it&#39;s intended &mdash; a guide to make it
easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
participate.</p>

<p>This policy applies to all spaces used by the Tails project. This
includes XMPP, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, the website,
events, and any other forums which the community uses for communication.</p>

<p>If you believe someone is violating this policy, we ask that you report
it by emailing <a href="mailto:tails@boum.org">tails@boum.org</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be considerate.</strong></p>

<p>Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on
the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and other
contributors, and you should take those consequences into account when
making decisions. Remember that we&#39;re a world-wide community, so you
might not be communicating in someone else&#39;s primary language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong></p>

<p>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse
for poor behavior and poor manners.  We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
into a personal attack. It&#39;s important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
Members of the Tails community should be respectful when dealing with
other members as well as with people outside the Tails community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong></p>

<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&#39;t acceptable. This
includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Exhibiting sexually explicit or violent speak or material.</li>
<li>Publishing (or threatening to publish) other people&#39;s personally
identifying information (&quot;doxing&quot;).</li>
<li>Recording, photographing or filming other persons without their
consent. Seek consent before recording. Also ask people who may be
seen or heard in the background. Similarly, don&#39;t publish private
communication without asking first, except if the communication
was unwanted (harrassment, threats etc). In doubt, you can ask us
before publishing something.</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
stop, then stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong></p>

<p>Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and
Tails is no exception.  It is important that we resolve disagreements
and differing views constructively. Remember that we&#39;re different. The
strength of Tails comes from its varied community, people from a wide
range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
issues.  Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint
doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re wrong. Don&#39;t forget that it is human to err
and blaming each other doesn&#39;t get us anywhere. Instead, please
consider offering your help in order to resolve issues and to help
learn from mistakes.</p></li>
